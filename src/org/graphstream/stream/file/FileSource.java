/**
 * Source of graph events coming from a file.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The file input interface is an input with specific methods that deals with files. File inputs
 * are designed to handle graphs stored under the form of a textual or binary file either under
 * the form of a file name or a Java input stream. If the file comes from an URL, convert the URL
 * to an input stream.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The file package is designed under the idea that it provides graph inputs from files that
 * store the graph under a given file format and encoding. The package provides decoders for
 * all these formats.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Do not confuse the file package with the net package that can also read from URLs, but build
 * graph not from encoded description of a graph, but from web services like Flickr or Amazon, or
 * simply networks of web pages tied by web links. The graph construction task is entirely
 * different.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although not all graph format handle dynamic graphs, all file inputs must provide both the
 * readAll() and begin()/nextEvents()/end() methods. The later must read one graph modification
 * at a time.
 * </p>
