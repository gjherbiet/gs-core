/**
 * Base implementation for graph output to files.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class provides base services to write graphs into files using a specific file format. It
 * allows to create an output stream. By default a print stream for easy text output, but binary
 * files are possible.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It handles completely the {@link #writeAll(Graph, OutputStream)},
 * {@link #writeAll(Graph, String)}, {@link #begin(OutputStream)}, {@link #begin(String)},
 * {@link #flush()} and {@link #end()} methods. You should not have to modify or override these.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to implement an output you have to:
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>Eventually override {@link #createOutputStream(OutputStream)} or
 * 			{@link #createOutputStream(String)} to replace the default instance of
 * 			PrintStream created for you.</li>
 * 		<li>Implement the {@link #outputHeader()} method. This method is called at
 * 			start, before any graph event is sent to output. Use it to output the header of
 * 			your file.</li>
 * 		<li>Implement the {@link #outputEndOfFile()} method. This method is called at
 * 			the end of the output, just before closing the output stream. Use it to output
 * 			any terminating syntax for the file format you implement.</li>
 * 		<li>Implement all the methods of {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink}. All these
 * 			methods will be called for each graph event and must export these events to
 * 			the file you are writing. You should use the {@link #output} field to write
 * 			to the file. This field has type {@link java.io.OutputStream} but by default
 * 			is of type {@link java.io.PrintStream}, as most of the file format will
 * 			be textual.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
