/**
 * A simple source of graph events that takes an existing graph and creates a flow of events by
 * enumerating all nodes, edges and attributes of the graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The only method of this class is {@link #replay(Graph)} that takes a graph as argument and :
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>First exports all graph attributes as attribute-addition events.</li>
 * 		<li>Then exports all nodes as node-creation events.
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>For each node exports all the node attributes as attribute-addition events.</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>Then exports all edges ad edge-creation events.
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>For each edge exports all the edge attribute as attribute-addition events.</li>
 * 			</ul>
 *		</li>
 * </ul>
 * In this order.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that this is a source, not a pipe. This means that it has its own identifier and is a
 * producer of "new" events. Also note that is does not export the dynamics of the graph, only
 * its structure at the present time (the evolution of the graph is not stored in the graph,
 * to produce a dynamic flow of events of the evolution of a graph you have to register the
 * sinks in the graph itself just after its creation).
 * </p>
