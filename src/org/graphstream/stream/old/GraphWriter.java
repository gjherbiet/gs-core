/**
 * Graph writer interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A graph writer allows to save a graph to a file or output stream. The writer
 * interface is format independent, however it is made to support dynamic
 * graphs. Writers are available for common graph formats, as well as graphical
 * outputs, etc.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface works by events. The output to a new file or stream must be
 * initiated using the {@link #begin(String, String)} or
 * {@link #begin(OutputStream, String)} methods. Then you declare nodes and
 * edges, change them, or even delete them. Finally, every graph file or stream
 * must imperatively be closed using the {@link #end()} method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although this interface is generic, it proposes some methods that may not
 * result in any output. The {@link #step(double)} method is probably the method
 * that will not have any counterpart in any known graph format, excepted the
 * DGS format.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface allow to output not only the graph structure (nodes and
 * edges), but also the attributes stored on each node and edge. As when
 * outputting a graph, it is easy to pass the attribute set of nodes and edges
 * directly to {@link #addNode(String, Map)} and {@link #addEdge(String, String, String, boolean, Map)}
 * for example, methods have been added to allow attribute filtering. Indeed,
 * one does not necessarily need to output all the attributes stored in a graph.
 * Some attribute may be impossible to output, depending on the graph
 * format. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graph writers will do their best to output each attribute as precisely as
 * possible, but only few graph writers will be able to output arbitrary objects.
 * Some mays even not be able to output attributes at all. The writers specify
 * themselves what they do with attributes. Most of them will probably ignore
 * silently the attributes they cannot output, or transform the value in something
 * they can output (a string). Read the writers individual documentation for
 * information.
 * </p>
