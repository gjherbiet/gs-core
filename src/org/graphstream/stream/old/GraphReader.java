/**
 * Graph reader interface.
 *
 * <p>Interface for various readers. A graph reader allows to parse a graph
 * format on disk or from a stream and to send events describing this graph to a
 * {@link GraphReaderListenerExtended}. This allows to describe both static and dynamic
 * graphs. Indeed, the graph listener will receive an event notification each
 * time something is read in the graph (a node or edge appearance, disappearance
 * or change). In static graphs, events are node and edge appearance only. In
 * dynamic graphs, nodes and edges can also disappear or change.</p>
 *
 * <p>To receive events, one must register a listener using
 * {@link #addGraphReaderListener(GraphReaderListenerExtended)} (the old
 * GraphReaderListener is deprecated in favor of {@link GraphReaderListenerExtended}
 * in order to process attribute addition and removal).</p>
 *
 * <p>The graph can be read in two ways. A first way is to read the whole graph
 * at once. Simply call the {@link #read(String)}, {@link #read(InputStream)}
 * or {@link #read(Reader)} methods to do this.
 * However, as this is a blocking call that will give back control only when the
 * whole graph has been read, this is not usable for dynamic graphs.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The other way is to begin reading the header of the graph file using the
 * {@link #begin(String)}, {@link #begin(InputStream)} or {@link #begin(Reader)}
 * methods and then
 * process events one by one by calling the {@link #nextEvents()} method in a
 * loop while it returns true. When there are no more events, one must then call
 * {@link #end()} to close the file or stream.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Events in dynamic graphs can be grouped in atomic groups using "steps".
 * To read a graph step by step instead of event by event, one can use {@link #nextStep()}
 * instead of {@link #nextEvents()}. Notice however that very few graph formats
 * handle steps and this method becomes almost equal to the "read()" methods if
 * no steps are available.</p>
 * 
 * <p><em>The GraphReaderListener interface is still usable, but its usage is
 * depreciated since it was not possible to receive attribute removal events
 * with it.</em></p>
