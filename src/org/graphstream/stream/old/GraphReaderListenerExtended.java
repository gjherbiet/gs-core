/**
 * Dynamic graph reader listener.
 *
 * <p>A graph can be either static or dynamic. A static graph does not change
 * over time, whereas a dynamic one can vary. Each method of this interface
 * represents a variation in a graph. Such events are the apparition,
 * removal or change of a node or edge.</p>
 * 
 * <p>As dynamic graphs vary over time, a notion of time is introduced in this
 * interface by the {@link #stepBegins(double)} method. This allows to split the
 * graph description in discrete time steps. The argument of this method is the
 * current time. Each event received after a step event can be considered
 * occurring at this time.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Notice that a static and a dynamic graph can be described using this same
 * interface without changes. Indeed, one can listen at each event and directly
 * reflect changes in the graph (dynamic way), or listen at all events, and only
 * when no more events are available, reflect the changes (static way).</p> 
 * 
 * <p>Each method of the listener is declared to throw GraphParseException.
 * You can throw this exception when the data received, for example in
 * attributes, is not the one expected. This will interrupt the parser
 * (GraphReader) that will in turn throw a GraphParseException.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This interface is the evolution of the original GraphReaderListener.
 * It adds the ability to add or remove individual attributes to node, edges and
 * graphs. The GraphReaderListener is depreciated by this interface.</p>
