/**
 * A major package responsible for the production and management of streams of events. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * GraphStream deal with dynamic graphs. The idea of dynamics is handled by the general idea that elements 
 * of the dynamics are events thats occur at given dates. this events are produced by producers (or sources) 
 * and a aimed at target (sinks). A set of events moving from a source to a sink it a stream of events. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Streams are produced form an outside source of events. See the {@link org.graphstream.stream.Source} Interface for more information 
 * about event producers. It can be a file (with it's own description of a graph format) or any file descriptor 
 * like an url. See the {@link org.graphstream.stream.file.FileSource} interface for more information about 
 * file-based event producers. It can also be originated from another program running in another thread (see 
 * {@link org.graphstream.stream.ProxyPipe} and {@link org.graphstream.stream.thread.ThreadProxyPipe}).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Objects responsible for receiving streams of events and dealing with it are {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink}s. 
 * Sinks can produce output files (see {@link org.graphstream.stream.file.FileSink})or being used to display the graph on a screen.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p> Some objects are both {@link org.graphstream.stream.Source} and {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink}, 
 * they receive events but also send some events. They are {@link org.graphstream.stream.Pipe}s. The 
 * {@link org.graphstream.graph.Graph} interface is a famous {@link org.graphstream.stream.Pipe}.
