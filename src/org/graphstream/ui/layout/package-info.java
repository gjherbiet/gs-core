/**
 * Various graph layout algorithms (visual organisation of a graph).
 * 
 * <p>
 * A graph layout algorithm takes as input a graph description and outputs
 * position in the 2D or 3D space for each node of the graph according to some
 * constraints. Most of the time the constraints are that the graph must be
 * easy to visualise, with the less possible edge crossing and node overlapping.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <tt>Layout</tt> and <tt>LayoutListener</tt> interfaces are the main definition of a layout.
 * They are quite low level. The <tt>elasticbox</tt> is an implementation of these interfaces.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <tt>LayoutAlgorithm</tt> is the class you need to use if you want to apply
 * a layout to a graph (store x,y,z coordinates in the graph) without opening
 * a graph viewer.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <tt>LayoutRunner</tt>, <tt>LayoutListenerProxy</tt> are used by the graph viewer to
 * run the layout in a thread and communicate with this thread.
 * </p>
