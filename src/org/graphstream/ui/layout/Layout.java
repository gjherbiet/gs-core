/**
 * Layout algorithm interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The layout algorithm role is to compute the best possible positions of nodes
 * in a given space (2D or 3D). As there are many such algorithms with distinct
 * qualities and uses, this interface defines what is awaited from a layout
 * algorithm.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The algorithm follows a graph by being a {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink}.
 * However, at the contrary of several other algorithms, it does not work on the
 * graph itself. It works on a description of the graph and maintains its own
 * vision of this graph. In return, it does not modify the graph, but sends
 * events to listeners telling the new positions of nodes in the graph.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here a layout algorithm continuously updates its internal representation of
 * the graph following a given method and outputs its computations to a listener
 * for each element of the graph (iterative algorithm). Such a layout algorithm
 * is not made to compute a layout once and for all. This is the best way to
 * handle evolving graphs.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This behaviour has been chosen because this algorithm is often run aside the
 * main thread that works on the graph. We want a thread to be able to compute a
 * new layout on its side, without disturbing the main algorithm run on the
 * graph. See the {@link org.graphstream.ui.old.layout.LayoutRunner} for an
 * helper class allowing to create such a thread.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To be notified of the layout changes dynamically, you must register a
 * {@link LayoutListener} that will be called each time a node changes its
 * position.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graph viewers in the UI package often use a layout algorithm to present
 * graphs on screen.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * TODO: would it be interesting, for some layouts, to have edges that contain
 * "break points" or curve points (Bezier for example) that are also moved by
 * the layout algorithm ?
 * </p>
