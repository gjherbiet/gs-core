/**
 * Set of views on a graphic graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The viewer class is in charge of maintaining :
 * <ul>
 * <li>A "graphic graph" (a special graph that internally stores the graph under
 * the form of style sets of "graphic" elements),</li>
 * <li>The eventual proxy pipe from which the events come from (but graph events
 * can come from any kind of source),</li>
 * <li>A default view, and eventually more views on the graphic graph.</li>
 * <li>A flag that allows to repaint the view only if the graphic graph changed.
 * <li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graphic graph can be created by the viewer or given at construction (to
 * share it with another viewer).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once created, the viewer runs in a loop inside the Swing thread. You cannot
 * call methods on it directly if you are not in this thread. The only operation
 * that you can use in other threads is the constructor, the
 * {@link #addView(View)}, {@link #removeView(String)} and the {@link #close()}
 * methods. Other methods are not protected from concurrent accesses.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some constructors allow a "ProxyPipe" as argument. If given, the graphic
 * graph is made listener of this pipe and the pipe is "pumped" during the view
 * loop. This allows to run algorithms on a graph in the main thread (or any
 * other thread) while letting the viewer run in the swing thread.
 * </p>
