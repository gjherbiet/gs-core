/**
 * Definition of some compound value that can be used as attribute and can be
 * transformed to a hash map.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this class is to allow to specify how some values are stored
 * in the graph and can be exported to files (or others) when the graph is
 * output. Most graph writers can only handle basic types for attributes (when
 * they are able to store attributes in files). This interface may allow to
 * store more complex attributes, made of several elements. The DGS writer is
 * able to understand these kinds of attributes and store them in files.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The compound attribute is made of fields. Each fields has a name and a value.
 * For these fields to be exported successfully, they must be transformable to a
 * hash map where each element is indexed by its name (a String).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For the values to be exported successfully, they must either be basic types,
 * or be themselves instances of CompountAttribute.
 * </p>
